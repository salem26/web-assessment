            My name's Salem OJu and I've been given this web development assignment by Chris to make a front end design of my very own website. I practiced most of the work in the library cuz I'm less serious at home for some reason. My deadline day for this assignment is on the 18th of April, almost a month after my birthday, although I'm not the best at this module I have tried my best to learn and understand this assignment. This project has taken me almost a month to complete, its a good thing this is Javascript and not Java because i find Java to be very challenging. While working on this assignment i did my best to follow all neccessary
